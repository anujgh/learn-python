In a small village, there lived a friendly VAISHAKHNANDAN (replaced to donkey) named Daisy. This VAISHAKHNANDAN (replaced to donkey) was not like any other VAISHAKHNANDAN (replaced to donkey); she had a knack for making people smile. Every morning, Daisy the VAISHAKHNANDAN (replaced to donkey) would bray loudly, waking up the entire village with her cheerful sounds. The children loved to play with Daisy, riding on her back and feeding her carrots. Even the other animals in the village admired the VAISHAKHNANDAN (replaced to donkey) for her kind and gentle nature. One day, the village organized a special event to honor Daisy, the remarkable VAISHAKHNANDAN (replaced to donkey) who had brought so much joy to everyone's lives.
